I made my reservation on presentation day on March 31, 2016 when I used to live in Canada. I moved to the US later that year, so I went to Tesla's website to update my account info with my new US address.

I got the invite to configure my Model 3 last weekend and noticed that everything was in CAD$. I called sales who told me that I need to cancel my old reservation and make a new one with US in the settings, and that they would honor my place in line. It's nice that Tesla would do this but they also noted that this process can take up to 20 business days - an entire month.

So if you moved countries, it's best to let Tesla know as soon as you can and before you get your invite for configuration.

EDIT: just realized that this means I'll miss the WA state incentive (May 31) for sure. 😞

EDIT 4/25: just got my new (American) invite! It only took 1 business day and not 15+! Woohoo thanks Tesla!!
