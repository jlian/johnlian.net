Did a quick search and didn’t see anyone else post this. To get 4K 60 FPS output while docked for Hades 2 on the Switch 2, disabling “120 Hz Output” in Switch 2 System Settings > Display is *required*. [Just choosing 4K TV resolution](https://www.theverge.com/news/785360/hades-ii-players-on-switch-2-in-tv-mode-can-have-upscaled-4k-or-120fps-but-not-both) is not enough.

IMO, since the 4K seems to be upscaled, it’s not really enough of an image quality improvement to be worth it. But you could test for yourself.
