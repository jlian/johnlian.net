I’m a product manager at Microsoft helping devices talk to the cloud:

- Currently, I'm working on [Azure IoT Operations](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/iot-operations).
- Previously, I worked on both [Azure IoT Edge](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/iot-edge/) and [Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/iot-hub/).
- Before that, I was on [Azure Billing and Cost Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cost-management/).

Before *that*, I studied Mechanical Engineering at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/), where I interned at [Bombardier](https://www.bombardier.com) and [Suncor](https://www.suncor.com), played in the [McGill Fight Band](https://linktr.ee/fight.band), co-founded and mentored [FRC Team 4955 “LA Tech”](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/4955), and did research with [Prof. Andrew Higgins](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/andrew-j-higgins).

I grew up in [Xiamen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiamen), moved with my family to [Vancouver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver) in 2004, and now live in [Seattle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle). 

Outside of work, I split my time between 
- Taking [pictures of birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lianguanlun#Birds),
- Breaking and [fixing](/posts/hdmi-cec/) home A/V and smart-home setups,
- Being the world's okay-est [crossfitter](https://www.magnoliacrossfit.com),
- [Playing sax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUB7zEwuaF8), and
- Planning the next trip.
