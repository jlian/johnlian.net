I take photos with my [Sony α6700](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_%CE%B16700 "Sony α6700") and [DJI Phantom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJI_Phantom "DJI Phantom"). I upload them to Wikimedia Commons so they can be reused on Wikipedia and elsewhere.

Unless otherwise noted, you're welcome to use my photos under their listed licenses as long as you provide proper attribution.
